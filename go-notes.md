go notes
	no parenthese around for loops or if statements
	no while loops, use fors

	for {
		// infinite for (while (true))
	}

	return multiple values from a single function (typeA, typeB)

	example fn
		func fn (x, y float64) (float64, int) {

		}
		x, y both float64
		returns two values float64, int

	defer statements defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns. it acts as a stack so its lifo

	there are fucking pointers...
